          <h1>How to celebrate Valentine’s Day in the USA</h1>
          <p>Valentine’s Day, a festival of romantic love and care, is celebrated on the 14th of February. This old festival has taken a great importance in recent years. But Valentine’s Day is not considered as a public holiday in the USA. It means that stores, schools and different organizations work as usual.

</p>
			<p>People give small gifts or they exchange cards and love letters that express their feelings. The small present can be a bunch of flowers, chocolate, a teddy bear or jewelry and a dinner in a restaurant. It really depends on the people, their tastes, imagination and financial opportunities.

</p>
			<p>Many restaurants and hotels have special offers on this day. People who have romantic relationships usually book weekend breaks in hotels. Restaurants are busier than usual, because a lot of people are planning to spend an evening with their partners. Valentine’s Day is also popular day for date to make a marriage proposal.

</p>
		<p>This holiday is unlike of such holidays as Easter, Christmas or New Year, it’s a party that is not celebrated with the family. This holiday is only for two persons. If a married couple is going out, they invite a nanny who takes care of their children.</p>
